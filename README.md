# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## Description:

### Project Description:
This project is presented a prediction of the Heart Disease for young patients using Data Minings techniques.

### Files Description:
* Main.ipynb - main Jupyter notebook, where is presented main prediction work.
* outliers - in this folder is Outliers Jupyter notebook, Stat_outliers notebook and dataset file of outliers.
* stats - in this folder are presented three different Jupyter notebooks where visulize dependecies target values with other attributes. 
* data.csv - collected data in one dataset from different country 
* heart.csv - processed data

## Data description:
The data reviewed in this study was taken from the UCI Archive. The main data have about 900 rows, and processed data - about 300 rows. Its dataset was collected from different country, such as USA, Hungarian, Switzerland and Vatican

### Atrribute description:
- AGE - age
- SEX - gender
- CP - chest pain type
- TRESTBPS - resting blood pressure (in mm HG on admission to the hospital)
- CHOL - serum chorestoral in mg/dl
- FBS - fasting blood sugar >120
- RESTECG - resting electrographic result 
- THALACH - maximum heart rate achieved
- EXANG - exercise induced angina 
- OLDPEAR - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- CA - number of major vessels colored by flouroscopy
- THAL - “thalium”, the blood disorder
